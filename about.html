    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>  Hi, I’m B. Sai Roshan, a B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at S-VYASA Deemed to be University, Bangalore. Growing up in Bangalore, surrounded by technology and innovation, sparked my passion for both coding and business.

      I’m deeply interested in how technology can drive real-world solutions, whether it’s through AI projects, coding, or exploring online business ventures. I enjoy taking on new challenges, learning continuously, and finding creative ways to apply my skills.
